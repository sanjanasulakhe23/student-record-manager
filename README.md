# 🎓 Student Record Management System (OOP + Tkinter)

This is a **mini project** developed using **Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles along with the **Tkinter GUI library**.  
It is a simple desktop application that allows you to **add, view, update, and delete student records**.

> ⚠️ This project is for **personal learning purposes only**, to better understand the concepts of OOP in Python.
